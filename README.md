# Algorithmic trading
# Stock predictions

Stock predictions is one of the primary stage of Algo trading, based on historical data using recurrent neural networks(RNN)and Long-Short Term Memory(LSTM) Algorithm.

1. Download the stock_prediction_LSTM.py file.
2. Download the .csv file as data input.
3. Add the .csv file in the path with the .py file (if needed add the name of .csv file in the python code base).
4. Run the code and wait for the plot to show up.
5. The output includes a> Actual plot of the data from .csv file 
                       b> Standard averaging plot
                       c> EMA averaging plot
                       d> LSTM plot
